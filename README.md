# Top_Music_Project1

We have collected a CSV file containing all YouTube videos uploaded in the United States, Great Britain, and Canada.
Using the YouTube API platform, we collected the category names pertaining to the category codes used in the CSV file that we are evaluating.

We assessed the following information:

>    1. The top five most viewed, liked, and disliked YouTube videos within each country
>    2. The top ten most viewed video categories within each country
>    3. The most viewed, liked, and disliked YouTube channels within each country

Using these evaluations, we compare the most viewed, liked, and dislilked videos, categories, and channels of each country.
